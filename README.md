# Smart Parking

Five-slot smart parking prototype with a FastAPI/SQLite server and a fully
hardware-independent demo path. The remaining optimizer, vision, prediction,
dashboard, and firmware milestones are tracked in `progress.md`.

## Backend foundation

Python 3.11 or newer is required. Create an isolated environment and install
the project:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run verification and start the development server:

```bash
make test
make lint
make run
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health`. The first startup creates the local SQLite
database and idempotently seeds the five slots from `config/parking.yaml`.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to override local configuration. Hardware mode
requires both `SMART_PARKING_MODE=hardware` and
`SMART_PARKING_HARDWARE_ENABLED=true`, preventing accidental physical-mode
startup. Local databases, secrets, calibrated ROIs, datasets, and generated
model artifacts are ignored by Git.
