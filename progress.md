# Smart Parking Project Progress

Last updated: 2026-09-03

## Current Status

Milestone 1 (backend foundation) is complete and verified on `main`. The service
loads typed configuration, initializes all planned SQLite tables idempotently,
seeds exactly five slots, and exposes `/health`.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Status | Evidence / exit condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design captured | Complete | `2026-09-03-smart-parking-design.md` |
| Architecture summarized | Complete | `architecture.md` |
| Agent workflow documented | Complete | `agents.md` |
| Decision log established | Complete | `decisions.md` |
| Local Git repository initialized | Complete | Repository on `main` with an initial documentation commit |
| Python/backend foundation | Complete | 6 tests pass; lint passes; health smoke reports five slots |
| Optimizer comparison | Not started | GA, PSO, and ACO use one cost interface and benchmark the same scenarios |
| Demo entry/exit API | Not started | Simulated RFID flow allocates only free slots and persists sessions |
| Vision occupancy pipeline | Not started | Five configurable ROIs, heuristic mode, smoothing, and tests work |
| Prediction comparison | Not started | Shared split evaluates LSTM, GRU, and Transformer with required metrics |
| Dashboard | Not started | Live five-slot state and both comparison tables are visible |
| Firmware integration | Not started | Both sketches build and complete the documented hardware flow |
| End-to-end demo | Not started | Seed, simulated camera, RFID entry, allocation, prediction, and UI run without hardware |

## Completed This Session

- Implemented the installable FastAPI backend foundation with typed environment
  and YAML configuration.
- Added all eight planned SQLite tables, transaction handling, and idempotent
  five-slot initialization.
- Added `/health`, isolated tests, developer commands, setup documentation, and
  ADR-007.
- Verified with `.venv/bin/python -m pytest` (6 passed),
  `.venv/bin/python -m ruff check .` (passed), `git diff --check` (passed), and a
  fresh TestClient health smoke response (`status=ok`, `slot_count=5`).

- Reviewed the supplied implementation design.
- Established architectural, agent, progress, and decision documentation.
- Added repository ignore rules for Python, ML, local configuration, databases, firmware builds, and editor files.
- Confirmed the GitHub plugin is already available.
- Installed the curated `jupyter-notebook` Codex skill for ML data exploration and model comparison work.
- Initialized the repository on the `main` branch and created the initial commit.
- Expanded `agents.md` with verified commit, safe push, and structured session-handoff procedures.

## Next Task

Begin Milestone 2 by defining the shared allocation request/result and objective
interfaces, then write deterministic optimizer contract tests.

## Blockers

None for demo-mode backend development. Physical integration will later require the final pin map, local Wi-Fi credentials, camera placement, calibrated ROI coordinates, and access to the listed hardware.
